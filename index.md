    <h2 class="post-title">Animation</h2>
    <p class="post-excerpt">While I prefer the feel and style of Motion Capture animation and have professional exxperience working mocap data, most of my background is in Hand Key Animation. This prefference, allows to strife for more subtle, weighted and "realistic" feel of my animation done in Maya, be it Locotion or Facial Animation.<br>
