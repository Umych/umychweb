    <h2 class="post-title">Technical Artist</h2>
    <p class="post-excerpt">I create custom rigs for bipedal and quadruped characters; designed and wrote a script and UI component for it in Maya's MEL scripting language. The script allows for modular rigging of various body parts independently. IK/FK switches are integrated.
    I worked as a tech artist on multiple projects in Unreal Engine 4. I took part in every part of the pipeline from importing assets generated in Maya to working with animation blueprints and animation sequences. <br>
