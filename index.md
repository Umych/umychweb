Primarially focusing on animation for video games, I specialize in both hand key and mocap data. I currently work at 2K Mocap as a Junior Motion Capture Animator. Resposibilities comprise all stages on the production, and the goal is to deliver animation that is ready for game engines. Depending on the project I contribute by markering-up and working with talent on stage, capturing ROMs and creating VSKs to cleaning marker data, retarger and motion edit final animations.

    <strong>Hand Key:</strong> Proficient at working in 3D environment with multiple characters, cameras and props. Naturally gravitated towards naturalistic, motion capture style of animation. This results in a desire for more subtle, weighted motionm while still following 12 principles of animation.<br> 
    <strong>Motion Capture:</strong> Professional experience working with motion capture equipment and data. Proficiently in workflow with assets, i.e. markercleanup in Shogun, motion edit in MotionBuilder, polish in Maya. Natural passion for performance, acting and character motion.
