    <h2 class="post-title">Animation</h2>
    <p class="post-excerpt">While I prefer the feel and style of Motion Capture animation and have professional exxperience working mocap data, most of my background is in Hand Key Animation. This prefference, allows to strife for more subtle, weighted and "realistic" feel of my animation done in Maya, be it Locotion or Facial Animation.<br>

    <h2 class="post-title">Technical Artist</h2>
    <p class="post-excerpt">I create custom rigs for bipedal and quadruped characters using script and UI components for it in Maya's MEL scripting language. The script allows for modular rigging of various body parts independently while incorporating IK/FK switches.
    I worked as a tech artist on multiple projects in Unreal Engine 4; importing assets generated in Maya to working with animation blueprints and animation sequences. <br>
