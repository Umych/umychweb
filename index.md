Rigging and techical art was never my first choice of descepline, the idea of creating my own custom rigs was nothing short of terrifying. However, due to the nature of projects I worked on and limited human resourses that we had, I was always the only animator on the given team. I had to quickly learn not only how to create robust rigs but also to implement them in engine. In the long run this not only helped to paint the full picture of processes that go before and after animating process but also helped me become ever so helpful as a developer on my past projects.

    <h2 class="post-title">Technical Artist</h2>
    <p class="post-excerpt">I create custom rigs for bipedal and quadruped characters using script and UI components for it in Maya's MEL scripting language. The script allows for modular rigging of various body parts independently while incorporating IK/FK switches.
    I worked as a tech artist on multiple projects in Unreal Engine 4; importing assets generated in Maya to working with animation blueprints and animation sequences. <br>
