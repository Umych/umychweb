Primarially focusing on animation for video games, I specialize in both hand key and mocap data. I currently work at 2K Mocap as a Junior Motion Capture Animator. Resposibilities comprise all stages on the production, and the goal is to deliver animation that is ready for game engines. Depending on the project I contribute by markering-up and working with talent on stage, capturing ROMs and creating VSKs to cleaning marker data, retarger and motion edit final animations.
