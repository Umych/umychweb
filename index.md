Primarially focusing on animation for video games I specialize in both handkey and mocap data. I currently work at 2K Mocap as a Junior Motion Capture Animator. Resposibilities, depending on the project, range from markering-up talent, creating ROMs and working with talent on stage to cleaning marker data, retarger and motion edit final animations.
