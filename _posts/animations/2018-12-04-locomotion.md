While locomotion cycles will not be my first choice of animation to work on, cycle cyclical movement could be tricky to get right, let alone try to add come flavor to it, I still try my best to add unique character to these animations.

Some projects I worked on, like Reaver, have single loop for running and walking movement:

Others, like Kwaku Anansi, used more advanced locomotion system, which included separate animation for each direction that character can move relatively to the camera. The running blending used 4 unique animations, while running required 8 clips in order to achieve more realistic blend between directions and poses.

Additionally, I created a handful of missalanious animations for Reaver, like animations for dodging enemy attacks, taking damage / stagger and knockback to name a few.
