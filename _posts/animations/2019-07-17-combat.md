Following animations are part of the <strong><a href="http://www.umych.com/projects/reaver/">Reaver</a></strong> game. See River's project page for more details. 

There are eight sword-based attacks in the game, four light attacks and four heavy respectively. The combat system of Reaver allows for either four consequetive light swings or player can end each previous light attack with a heavy attack. If a player uses heavy attack without initiating light attack first, then a seperate heavy attack will be play instead.
Example: 

**L1 > L2 > L3 > L4**  
**H1**  
**L1 > H2**  
**L1 > L2 > H3**  
**L1 > L2 > L3 > H4**

#### Light Attacks Seperate  
Example of all light attack seperate. Each animation has a transition to idle at the the of the attack, which allows for the end of the combo chain to seamlessly transition to idle animation.

#### Light Attacks Chained  
Example of all light attacks being triggered one after the other.  
**L1 > L2 > L3 > L4**

The though behind this sequence was to make Reaver believably swing sword from side to side while shifting weight and catching balance after each swing. This is done to emphesize the power that went into swing and account for the size and weight of the actual sword, which is oversized by design.

### Jump Attacks

Animation incorperates Reaver's jetpack thrusters to give him additional upwards propultion after the start of animation and ends up with a sword swing at landing.
In engine, animation is split into three parts:  
    - jump start of Reaver getting air and winding up for attack  
    - loop pose, to account for the height of the jump  
    - actuall attack, which is played when Reaver touches the gound

Animations presented are part of <strong><a href="http://umych.com/projects/reaver/">Reaver</a></strong> projects. See Reaver's project page for more details.

There are five finishers made for Reaver. Finishers are meant to be triggered on all enemies that share the same skeletal structure. Enemy portion of the animation sequence is later retargeted on all other enemy types in engine.
Finishers are meant to be flashy, yet grounded and relatively realistic way for the main character to finish an enemy and restore health in the process. 
All animation are root motion driven.
