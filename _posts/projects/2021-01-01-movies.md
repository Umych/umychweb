**Role:** Performance Capture Animator

**Tools:** Maya, FaceWare, ShotGrid
             
**Contributions:** I worked with an animation director on creating animation for acting shots for an indie animated movie. Personal contribution to the project included blocking out multiple acting shots whilst referencing storyboards, setting up cameras and props, ultimately twinning key poses.

**About:** After a scientific experiment went horribly wrong, a Native American girl and a wrongfully accused member of the political elite begin their quest to stay alive and inspire hope among survivors of a post-apocalyptic America by finding the long lost Declaration of Independence.
