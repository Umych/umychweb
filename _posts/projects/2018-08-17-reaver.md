**About:** Third Person Action Game. Reaver takes place in a cyberpunk world in the distant future.

The corporations have taken over the world of Reaver. When they’re not busy fighting amongst each other, they’re dealing with augmented gangs. These gangs make up for their lack of resources with ingenuity, numbers, and a fanatical dedication to their cause, profits, or just getting the shiniest new toys.

Reaver focuses on the conflict between Steiger Consolidated Arms, the biggest weapons manufacturer in the nation, and the Yellow Skulls gang. These two forces face off against each other, fighting for control of the SCA weapons manufacturing facility.
A gang as violent and psychotic as the Yellow Skulls poses a grave threat to Blackridge City on a good day. With access to the SCA’s weapons, they pose a threat to the world.

## Animations for Reaver

One of the key gameplay elements of Reaver is the ability to initiate "finishers" on stunned enemies to gain a portion of health back. This mechanic allowed for rootmotion driven interaction between two characters in a single scene animation for which would later be seamlessly triggered in game. Additionally, animations for Reaver include melee combo-chained system alongside locomotion system and aimoffset poses. 

### Finishers

There are five finishers in game meant to be triggered on all enemy types. Enemy portion of the animation sequence is retargeted on other enemies which share the same skeletal structure.
Finishers are meant to flashy yet grounded and relatively realistic way for the main character to finish an enemy and restore health in the process. 
All animation are root motion driven.
